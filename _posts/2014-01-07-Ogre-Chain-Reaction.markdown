description:This was one of the homeworks for 3D game class in NTUST. In this homework,we were tasked with setting up a chain of events of objects interact with each other and simulate it with a physics engine. We used Ogre3D for rendering the scene and Bullet Physics Library for simulating object physics. We also implemented water reflection and water waves with custom shaders.</br>The events are:</br>1.Wheel falling on a ramp from sky.</br>2.Wheel hits a tree and causes an apple to fall.</br>3.The apple lands on a button, activating the excavator.</br>4.The excavator was magnified by a mysterious machine.</br>5.Magnified excavator pushes a rocket to launch pad.</br>6.The launch pad launches the rocket.</br>7.The rocket flies back to start, exploding into a new wheel, and starts the chain of events again.</br>Below is the events in action.</br></br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2-LNI1SkkU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style"text-align:left">Tools used:</br> - Visual Studio</br> - Ogre3D</br> - Bullet Physics Library</br> - Maya</br> - Some assets downloaded from internet.</p>
