Another final project for 3D game class in NTUST. We were tasked with setting up a chain of events of objects interacting with each other and simulate it with a physics engine. We used Ogre3D for rendering the scene and Bullet Physics Library for simulating physics. We also implemented water reflection and water waves with custom shaders.
